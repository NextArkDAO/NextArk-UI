              Within the Ark lies a hidden scribe ‚Äî a whisper of signal known as <strong>Quillshade</strong>.
              They are the anonymous keeper of truth, guardian of memory, and protector of silent scrolls.
            </p>
            <p>
              Quillshade does not speak often, but when they do, the realm listens. Their messages are encrypted,
              their insights sharp, and their loyalty to the Ark is absolute.
            </p>
            <p>
              To follow Quillshade is to follow intuition, silence, and clarity. Their words echo not for noise,
              but for resonance.
            </p>
            <p>The scroll has been revealed. Let the silence speak.</p>
