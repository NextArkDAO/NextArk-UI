      <h1>🌀 Bitsy’s Mission 001</h1>
      <h2>💡 What is Bitcoin?</h2>
      <p><strong>Bitcoin</strong> is like digital treasure that no one can steal, melt, or fake.</p>

      <p>Welcome to your first scroll, Ark Builder. 🧱<br />
      Your mission: Learn what makes Bitcoin more than just internet money.</p>

      <p>Every time you complete a scroll, you unlock knowledge <em>✨and</em> a digital badge.<br />Let’s begin.</p>

      <hr />

      <h3>🧠 Core Class</h3>
      <p>
        Bitcoin is protected by energy – the kind that’s produced by computers. <br />
        It’s stored in something called a <strong>blockchain</strong> – a special code vault no one can change.
      </p>

      <p>There will only ever be 21 million Bitcoins. That makes it rare, like treasure. <br />
      Your scroll’s reward must be stored in something secure: a wallet.</p>

      <h3>🤔 Bitsy Asks:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Do you think 1 whole Bitcoin 💰 is too much or too little?</li>
        <li>Send it to someone you trust — would you?</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Talk to your scrollkeeper and explain your answer.</p>
